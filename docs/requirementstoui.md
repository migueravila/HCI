## The Method

When we read a couple of articles about How to build Interfaces from big websites and organizations like **The Interaction Design Org** or **Usability.gov** is a serie of advices or Heruistics instead of a concrete methodology.

This Method is build out of experience and using all of this Heurisitcs and Advices as a base.

The key point of achieving the high usability on a design is **iteration design**. To optimize the design gradually by evaluation from the early stages, and the evaluation process enables us to gather users feedback until the system reaches an acceptable level of usability.

We first have to rewrite and restructure Stories and Requirements and then prototype to build a flow diagram. And finally take a first step from the Design Thinking process: Iterate.

## Steps

### Rewrite user Stories

First we need to make an analysis of the user Stories and check if they're well detailed and of course if it fits with the product we want to build. 

If there aren't any User Stories writte we can use a tempalate made by the Scrum Methodology: [Scrum Stories](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/project-management/user-stories).

### Evaluating Requirements

We need to evaluate and rewrite the requirements with more details and using:

- Learnability
- Efficiency
- Memorability
- Errors
- Satisfaction

### Detail requirements for User Interfaces

We need to detail all the requirements in order to have a nice idea of where in the stories this requirement is going to have a principal participation and so we can translate it into an interface component.

### Prototype applying the Usability Heurisitcs.

The next step is to prototype while using the Usability Heuristics proposed by Jakob Nielsen.

1. Visibility of system status
2. Match between system and the real world
3. User control and freedom
4. Consistency and standards
5. Error Prevention
6. Recognition rather than recall
7. Flexibility and efficiency of use
8. Aesthetic and minimalist design
9. Helsps user recognise diagnose, and recover from errors
10. Help and documentation

### Build a Flow Diagram for understanding and analysis

Finally we develop a flow diagram to understand how the interface works and also how the data flows between screens and components. This gives us a general view so we can iterate in the product design if we need it.
