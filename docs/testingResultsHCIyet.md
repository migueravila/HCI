# Yet Another Meeting App

## Testing Results

### Important Research Questions

#### What are the most frequent areas of user error as determined by the number of user mis-clicks per task?

#### How effective is the user interface (UI) in guiding the user in various tasks?

## Used Tools

#### Maze & Figma

## Procedures

#### Prepare the tasks on a computer using Maze.

#### Complete tasks Simple tasks like, turn in homework and submitting a file to an online meeting were given to the user.

#### Users must navigate through the interface and complete the 3 assigned tasks that familiarize them with the application.

#### Users were also given the option to abort a task if they were unable to complete it.

#### Some users were dismissed while others remained to observe the next tester and take notes on their performance.

#### We had a total of 11 Testers

## Results

#### Using Maze, we were able to observe which pathways users took to accomplish each task as well how many misclicks each user made.



|  | Direct Success Misclick Rate:| Indirect Success Misclick Rate: |Gave up Misclick Rate: |
| --- | ---| --- | --- |
| Scenario 1 (Join a call) | 5.6% for 6 users 0% for 1 user | 0% for 2 users | 31.6% for 1 user |
| Scenario 2 (Submit a file) | No users took the direct pathway | 7.4% for 9 users 37.5% for 1 user |No user gave up|
| Scenario 3 (Submit homework) | 3.7% for 9 users | 0% for 1 user |No user gave up |



#### We had a Interesting path while the testers were doing the task, for example, on the first scenario people understood that there could be more than one path to solve the scenario

#### While we were doing the test we did a satisfaction questionnaire asking for the next questions

#### Our prototype has a lot of good things, but there are also other opinions that do not make our prototype as a Bad prototype but it shows us that there is thing to get better at.

## Conclusion

#### Based on the data and results, we conclude that the interface is user friendly as well as straightforward. The survey given at the end of the tasks indicate that all users did not feel particularly strongly positive or negative about their experience with YAMA. This shows that while the interface was mostly effective, small improvements could be made to further streamline the user experience.
