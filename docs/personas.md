# 🧍About the users
### Attributes
Following the [Persona Creation and Usage Toolkit](https://tecfa.unige.ch/tecfa/teaching/Ergo/textes/Periode1/persona_1.pdf "Persona Creation and Usage Toolkit") by Goerge Olsen, we use the **Specific Goals/Needs/Attitudes** to understand the needs and frustations that the users face due the hybrid classes. Also we include some **Biographic Background** to include some demographic profile and  webographics and for a better understanding of the users.

### Research Methods
#### Ethnographic research
We decide to use the ethnografic research to understand how the users behavior during hybrid classes to inspect some elements like the interaction with the students that are physicaly in the classroom with the teacher and with the students that are taking the classes online, we also want to see what tools the professors used during their classes and if they presented some difficulties with them.
The method we used is the **observational study**, so the team only observates the group but doesn't interferes in the environment or their behavior.
